# Final Reflections - Sprint Four 

In addition to the challenge specific reflections, answer the following questions:

### How confident are you with each of the Learning Competencies?



### Which parts of the this sprint made you feel smart?



### Which parts of this sprint made you feel un-smart?



### How did you look after yourself this sprint (stretching, breaks, rewards, etc)?
