# Code Readability

### What makes code more readable for you?

Indentation, keeping adrguments small and specific, and lots of comments!

### Do you prefer tabs or spaces when indenting?

Tabs

### What is your workspace like in real life? Clean? Messy? Is your code a reflection of that?

My workspace is always clean and tidy


# Testing

```
function testSum(){
    let expected = 7
    let actual = sum(5, 2)

    if (actual != expected) {
        console.log("It's broken..")
    } else {
        console.log("It works!")
    }
}
```
### Have a go at writing a "sum" function below that would make the above function print out `"It works!"`: 
```
function sum(a, b) {
  return a + b
}
testSum()
```

### Do you think you would prefer using Test Driven Development? Why?

Its hard to say at the moment, I think I need to understand more about writing tests but it does seem helpful.


# Kata

### How did you find using the tests? Confusing? Useful?

Useful

### What problem solving techniques did you implement in your coding flow?

Using chatGPT to guide me through the functions and expalin them, and avoiding asking it for the answer.

### What was the most challenging part of Super FlipFlop for you?

All of it!

### Did you want to change and refactor your code once you were finished?

No, although I'm thinkong of running through some of the challenges a second time.
