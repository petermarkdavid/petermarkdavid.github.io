# Listening and Looping version 2.0

### What was it like to be fully listened to?



### What was it like to listen fully?



# Code Readability

### What makes code more readable for you?



### Do you prefer tabs or spaces when indenting?



### What is your workspace like in real life? Clean? Messy? Is your code a reflection of that?




# Testing

```
function testSum(){
    let expected = 7
    let actual = sum(5, 2)

    if (actual != expected) {
        console.log("It's broken..")
    } else {
        console.log("It works!")
    }
}
```
### Have a go at writing a "sum" function below that would make the above function print out `"It works!"`: 
```

```

### Do you think you would prefer using Test Driven Development? Why?
