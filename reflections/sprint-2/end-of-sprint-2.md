# Final Reflections - Sprint Two 

In addition to the challenge specific reflections, answer the following questions:

### How confident are you with each of the Learning Competencies from this sprint?

Quite confident

### Which parts of this sprint made you feel capable?

Creating new blog pages and linking them to the CSS

### Which parts of this sprint made you anxious?

I used chat GPT to suggest imnprovements early on and that was a mistake as my CSS was overcomplicated.

### How's your self critical voice going? What kinds of things did it say to you this time? How much did they affect you?

I had a real panic early in the week and lost a lot of time due to the repo issue

### If you were at a bar and somebody asked you, "How do you make a website?" what would you say?

"It's quite easy!" All you need is a HTML file, a CSS file and an account on Github!
