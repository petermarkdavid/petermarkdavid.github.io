# Final Reflections - Sprint Two 

In addition to the challenge specific reflections, answer the following questions:

### How confident are you with each of the Learning Competencies from this sprint?



### Which parts of this sprint made you feel capable?



### Which parts of this sprint made you anxious?



### How's your self critical voice going? What kinds of things did it say to you this time? How much did they affect you?



### If you were at a bar and somebody asked you, "How do you make a website?" what would you say?
