# Your Blog 

### Can you describe the steps you did in this exercise in simple terms?

We copied a basic html page and used it to set up our own blog page, then created a css document and linked the html page to it.

### How are you finding working with the timeboxes?

Pretty good but its not my main driver



# Learn HTML and CSS 

### What obstacles did you come up against? How did you overcome them?

A few strange things in frecodecamp where I was sure the code was right and it wasn't accepting.  I did use the hints a few times.

### What are you proud of from this challenge?

Got through it super quick and I think I undertood the concepts


# DevTools Tutorial

### What did you notice about your learning style, strengths, and limitations when doing this crash course?

The crash course covered a lot and I found my mind wandering back to past work conversations with developers.  I tried not to focus too much on memorising the code and instead kept thinking high level.

### Did any blocks come up for you? How did you overcome them?

No blockers

### How many tabs do you have open in your web browser right now? What is the ratio of study related tabs to distraction related tabs?

12 tabs open and mainly study related

### Did you do something funny with the Dev Tools, like insert your own name into the DOM of a website? If not, try it out.

I changed the names of a website I used to work for.  Nothing funny, just testing


# Add HTML and CSS to your Blog Challenge

### Write a small story about HTML and CSS and their relationship. You could personify elements or speak from your own personal experience. The story should capture insight about the nature of HTML and CSS.  



### Any moments of surprise or joy? 



### If HTML and CSS were animals, which animals do you think they would be? Why?
