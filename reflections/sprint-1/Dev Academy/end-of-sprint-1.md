# Final Reflections - Sprint One 

In addition to the challenge specific reflections, answer the following questions:

### What parts of your learning strategy worked? What problems did you face?

I had to go back and redo a couple of times

### How confident are you with each of the Learning Competencies?

Pretty condfident after the redo and getting help to fix my repo with the facilitator

### Which parts of the work did you enjoy?

Putting the terms I've heard so often into practice

### Which parts of the work did you find tedious?

Getting in a mess with nested repo's

### Did you hear a self critical voice in your head throughout the process of learning during this sprint? What did it say to you? Do you believe what it said?

Yes, often.  I know I would get through it but I should have called for help earlier.
