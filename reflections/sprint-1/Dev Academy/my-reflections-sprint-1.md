# My Reflections - Sprint One 

In addition to the challenge specific reflections, answer the following questions:

# Command Line Primer 

<!-- Copy the answers you wrote in your temporary file earlier, under the sections below -->

### In a couple of sentences, how would you describe the command line in plain English? Can you think of an analogy for it?
Its a backdoor for navigating and creative files without needing to use the UI


### Did you stick to the timebox guidelines? If not, what change would you make next time?

Possibly a bit longer on some and shorter on others.  I've been juggling work and study this week so not been as focussed as I hope to be next sprint.

### Name 5 commands you used, and what they do.

1. Git clone - Copy a public repo from git hub
2. Git add - Add a new file
3. LS - List what is in the current directory
4. mkdir - make a directory
5. cd - move to a different place


### Did you learn anything unexpected?



# Version Control with Git 

A few essential commands to get familiar with
git clone [the url for a repository] - Copy an existing repository from a target location (such as GitHub) and create a matching version on your computer.
git status - Check the status of your repository. See which files are inside it, which changes still need to be committed, and which branch of the repository you’re currently working on.
git add [the name of a file you want to add, or ALL your files with the -A flag] - This does not add new files to your repository. Instead, it brings new files to Git’s attention. These added files are referred to as "tracked". After you add files, they’re included in Git’s “snapshots” of the repository.
git commit - Git’s most important command. After you make any change, you input this to take a “snapshot” of the repository. Usually, it goes git commit -m “Message here”. The -m indicates that the following section of the command should be read as a message.
git push - If you’re working on your local computer and want your commits to be visible online on GitHub, you “push” the changes up to GitHub with this command.
git help - Forgot a command? Type this into the command line to bring up the 21 most common Git commands. You can also be more specific and type git help init or another term to figure out how to use and configure a specific Git command.
git config - Short for “configure” is most useful when setting up Git for the first time.
git init - Initializes a new Git repository, i.e. turns the current folder into a Git folder. It's just a regular folder until you run this command inside a repository or directory. Only after you input git init does it accept further Git commands. Be careful just running this command in random places, if you create a git repository somewhere unexpected on your computer it can mess up your ability to interact with your other repositories. This is because if you have a git repository inside another git repository, only the "highest" repository will work. IE, if you created a git repository inside your Documents folder, no other git repositories inside your documents folder would work anymore.


### What's the difference between git and GitHub?

git is local and github is public

### Can you think of an analogy to describe them?

git is like a personal notepad and github is like a shared online document

### Do you think you would still remember the difference a week from now if you didn't revisit the material?

Yes

### Did you stick to the timebox suggestions? If not, why not?

Varied because I was still working this week but still made short sessions.

### What is a Git workflow?

A time machine of changes

### What did you notice about your own learning? What did you do when you were confused or blocked?

A few times I took a break and then backtracked a little the next time

### Is there anything you'd do differently if you were to repeat the learning exploration again?

nope

### How would you describe stage and commit to your non-tech-savvy friend?

allowing Github to see the changes, and then actually merging the changes into the main timeline

# Branch, Pull, Merge

### What is main?

Main used to be called master - its the fully functioning "best version" of the code

### Why create a Branch?

So that you can work on new features and fixes without disturbing the main version

### Do the concepts introduced feel intuitive or difficult to understand?  

Intuitive

### What are some examples of when you would fork?

When working on a public repo


### Did you have any moments where it all clicked? What clicked?

Hmm not really

# Setup Repo & Create Blog

### Reflect on this activity. When did you feel frustrated?

I forgot the final commit but quickly figured thaqt out

### If you didn't already know that this is the way websites are made, was it what you pictured? How does the reality of this process differ from your preconceptions?


Very different than I pitured, I suppose I thought there would be more UI guidance

# Thinking like a programmer

### What is your process so far for solving problems?

Take a few steps back and try again, or take a break if really stuck

### Have a look at what the internet says on how to think like a programmer. What patterns do you see? What do you notice?

Programmers think in small steps, test constantly, and treat problems as puzzles to be explored instead of obstacles.

### What does the internet say about flipped learning? What is flipped learning and flipped classroom? How do you think it will relate to your learning journey?

Flipped learning shifts the "lecture" outside class and brings the "homework" into class — so students spend valuable classroom time doing, not just listening.

# Introduce yourself

### What was it like trying to summarise yourself to a group of strangers? 

Awkward as I don't want to sound like i'm a show off

### Could you feel your ego? Were you self conscious? 

Yes, self consious and didn't know my values
