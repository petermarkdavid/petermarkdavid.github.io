# Foundations Reflections

This repo will be what you use to record your reflections questions during foundations.

During foundations sprints you will be asked to copy and complete questions into these files relating to the primer/challenge you have just completed.

Currently the files (that are in the folders for each sprint) hold a number of questions already. These are to be completed as you make your way through the primers and challenges, and at the very end of the sprint.

## Creating your own reflections repo

Follow the instructions during sprint 1 to fork this repo to your own github account. Once there you can clone it down to your own computer and push any changes up to your github for your facilitators to see, or edit it directly on github.

## Editing Instructions
#### GitHub:
1. Open a file for editing by clicking on the little pencil button in the right corner of the bar above (when looking at an individual file).
2. Once you've made all the appropriate changes, save your work by committing them in the box below the file.
3. Pull these saved changes down to the main branch of your local repo by using the command `git pull origin main`

#### VS Code:
1. Open this folder in VS Code (using a terminal command such as `code .` when in the reflections folder)
2. Once you've made all the appropriate changes, save your file.
3. Add, commit, and then push your changes back to GitHub using `git push origin main`

*NB:* This has been created as a private repo so will not be viewable to anyone outside of foundations.
