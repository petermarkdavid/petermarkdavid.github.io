# My Reflections - Sprint Three

# Mindfulness 

### Do you have any biases for or against mindfulness? If so, can you describe them?

I have a bias from work after there was a group of people that practiced mindfullness early in the workday.  I saw this as unnessecary and self indulgent.

### How did you find the overall experience? 

Surprisingly I did enjoy the mindfullness exercise.  I came closeto falling asleep but I felt quite refreshed after it.

### What's your daily habit commitment for mindfulness? 
    
I have downloaded the app and I will attempt one meditation a day, early in the day or additionally if I am struggling with focus.



# Listening and Looping 

### What was it like to be fully listened to? 

I was a little self aware and I was surprised that Patrick was able to summarise my 2 mins in closer to one minute.

### What was it like to fully listen?

At first it did feel like a test but it was much easier to focus on what Patrick was saying when I was not responding or joining in the conversation.
