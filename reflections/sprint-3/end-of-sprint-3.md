# Final Reflections - Sprint Three 

In addition to the challenge specific reflections, answer the following questions:

### How confident are you with each of the Learning Competencies?

I feel that I have a good overview of the content, however confidence in writing the JavaScript from scratch is very low.  I'm planning to go back to the strech exercises in JavaScript cafe and resit the urge to use AI helpers.

### Which parts of the this sprint made you feel happy?

Resolving my repo issues more easily that previously makes me feel like I've cemented the Sprint 1 and 2 concepts.

### Which parts of this sprint made you angry?

It seemed like I was behind other people when it came to Thursday.  I wouldn't say angry but most of the other blogs I have read are way better than mine in both content and design.

### How many times during this sprint did you want to give up? Why didn't you?

Didn't want to give up, but did get frustrated a few times.
