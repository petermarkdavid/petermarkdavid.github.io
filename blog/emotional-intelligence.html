    <p>
<h2>What is Emotional Intelligence?</h2>

Emotional Intelligence is being aware of your own emotions, and the ability to manage them.  It’s also the ability to perceive, influence and respond appropriately to other peoples emotions.

The Factors of EQ are self awareness, self regulation, motivation, empathy and social skills.


<h2>How is EQ different to IQ?</h2>
IQ stands for Intelligence Quotient, which measures cognitive ability.  This is things like reasoning, memory, abstract thinking and problem solving.

EQ is Emotional Quotient which measures emotional and social skills. This includes how you navigate relationships, manage stress and connect with others.

If IQ is about thinking then EQ is about feeling.
 
<h2>Why is EQ important?</h2>
EQ is important personally and professionally for many reasons including building better relationships but being able to better communicate, resolve problems and build trust with others.  

In work, leaders with higher EQ are able to inspire and motivate others and teams with high EQ members collaborate more effectively.  

Having higher EQ lets you better recognise existing biases and make better balanced decisions and helps with resilience to manage stress and problems.
