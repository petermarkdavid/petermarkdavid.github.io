    <h1>Neuroplasticity</h1>
<h2 id="def">What is Neuroplasticity?</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>“Neuroplasticity is the selective organising of connections between neurons in our brains.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“The brain's ability to reorganise itself by forming new neural connections throughout life.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In short, neuroplasticity is the brain’s ability to change, adapt, and strengthen connections. It’s not fixed. We can literally re‑shape how we think, learn, and behave.</p>
</section>


<section aria-labelledby="benefits">
<h2 id="benefits">Why it matters</h2>
<p>Understanding neuroplasticity changes how we show up to learn. Studies have found that students who learn about neuroplasticity tend to do better at school—because they see effort as a lever, not a chore.</p>
<p>Instead of assuming intelligence is predetermined, they believe they can learn and achieve, so they practice. And that practice changes the brain. <strong>Practice makes permanent</strong>, and <strong>cells that fire together, wire together</strong>. Knowing this keeps me leaning into learning rather than tapping out early.</p>
</section>


<section aria-labelledby="engage">
<h2 id="engage">How I’m engaging with it</h2>
<p>When I hit a tough concept (hello, new coding topics), I remind myself: I can learn this. It’ll take focus and reps, but my brain is built to adapt. That shift in mindset is practical and calming.</p>
</section>


<section aria-labelledby="increase">
<h2 id="increase">Ways to increase neuroplasticity</h2>
<p>Practice is key, but <em>how</em> we practice matters. I use the mnemonic <strong>AGES</strong>:</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><strong>Attention</strong> — single‑task, reduce distractions, be present.</li>
<li><strong>Generation</strong> — create something with the idea: code it, teach it, test it.</li>
<li><strong>Emotion</strong> — connect it to something that matters to you.</li>
<li><strong>Spacing</strong> — study in spaced sessions; revisit over days/weeks.</li>
</ul>
<p>Those four make learning stick.</p>

<p>Neuroplasticity gives us power. Each focused session, each tiny improvement, is literally shaping future me.</p>

<section aria-labelledby="growth">
<h2 id="growth">Growth Mindset</h2>
<p><strong>What it is and why it’s relevant:</strong> Growth mindset is the belief that we’re on a learning curve. It’s not “I can’t do this,” it’s “I can’t do this <em>yet</em>.” With practice, I can.</p>
<p><strong>What surprised me:</strong> how much the word <em>yet</em> shifts the room. Knowing everyone can learn is liberating—and keeps me persistent.</p>
<p><strong>How I’ll use it:</strong> When I’m studying new concepts, I’ll remind myself I’m capable; I just need focus and practice. Progress takes time—and that’s fine.</p>

<section aria-labelledby="plan">
<h2 id="plan">How this shapes my learning plan</h2>
<ul class="list">
<li>Keep focus: single‑task and cut noise.</li>
<li>Keep practicing: short, regular sessions with spacing.</li>
<li>Build and teach: generate something tangible.</li>
<li>Track tiny wins: reinforce the habit loop.</li>
</ul>
<p>I’m capable of becoming a developer.</p>
