    <h1>Problem Solving</h1>
</head>
<body>
  <h2>A time I was blocked on a simple problem</h2>
  <p>
    This week I spent many hours stuck on a problem that turned out to be much simpler than I expected — literally, a typo in my code.
    At first, I tried reading the error messages, but they didn’t make much sense. Eventually, I turned to ChatGPT when all else failed.
    At first, this felt like cheating, since I don’t want to shortcut my learning. But ChatGPT quickly exposed the typos I had become blind to.
  </p>
  <p>
    I realised I shouldn’t rely on it for direct solutions, as that would short-circuit my learning. Instead, I can use it to understand
    topics and functions more deeply, which then helps me solve problems myself.
  </p>

  <h2>A time I elegantly solved a problem</h2>
  <p>
    Another time, I needed to filter out all the odd numbers from a list in the JavaScript Olympics exercise. I remembered a note I’d taken
    from an earlier ChatGPT prompt: one line of code using <code>.filter</code> with <code>% 2 === 0</code> did the trick. It was elegant,
    short, and clear.
  </p>
  <p>
    That felt really satisfying — the tests passed, and I was able to move on confidently to the next challenge.
  </p>

  <h2>Reflection on problem-solving techniques</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Pseudocode:</strong> Pretty confident — writing in plain English helps me see the big picture.</li>
    <li><strong>Trying something:</strong> Very confident, but I’ve learned to balance experimentation with reflection instead of just trying random combinations.</li>
    <li><strong>Rubber ducky method:</strong> I need more practice. I’ve sometimes used AI tools like a “rubber duck,” though they give me responses rather than just listening.</li>
    <li><strong>Reading error messages:</strong> Getting better! It’s very satisfying when the test output points directly to the issue.</li>
    <li><strong>Console.logging:</strong> Confident — although I should use this more often instead of skipping ahead.</li>
    <li><strong>Googling:</strong> Extremely confident — though I’ve been too quick to use AI tools instead.</li>
    <li><strong>Asking peers for help:</strong> Still a little hesitant. I sometimes feel like I’m either ahead or behind, and I know how unpleasant it feels to fall behind.</li>
    <li><strong>Asking coaches for help:</strong> I’ve only asked once so far, when I was really frustrated with a repo issue.</li>
    <li><strong>Improving with reflection:</strong> Growing here — looking back helps me avoid repeating mistakes.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>A time I was reluctant to ask for help</h2>
  <p>
    In the first sprint, I kept hitting the same wall but didn’t want to admit I was stuck. I worried people would think the problem was too
    “basic” and that I should’ve already known the answer. Eventually, I asked David, the facilitator, for help, and he solved it in two minutes.
  </p>
  <p><strong>What I’d try differently next time:</strong> ask sooner.</p>
