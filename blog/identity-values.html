    <h1>Identity, Values and Strengths Exploration</h1>
<p><strong>Describe a situation where you have made an ethical decision. Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made, and how you reflect on the decision now.</strong></p>
<p>In a previous role I made a decision to escalate what I perceived to be very poor behaviour from a senior leader when talking to another leader.  I talked to the person that was targeted who was not as concerned as I was, and then decided to further escalate the behaviour with examples and facts.</p>
<p><strong>Describe how your culture and the people around you have influenced your values and identity.</strong></p>
<p>I’ve worked in a lot of different organisations with very different cultures through difficult times.  I feel you have to behave how your own intuition guides you.</p>
<p><strong>Identify your strengths and how they will support you during your learning journey.</strong></p>
<p>My strengths are honesty and speaking up for what’s fair.  I feel like I will be able to ask for help when I need it and let people know when I’m not having a good experience, 
<p><strong>Evaluate your limitations in terms of your learning and career development. How might these affect your learning journey?</strong></p>
<p>I sometimes feel that “you can’t teach an old dog new tricks” and I act on intuition.  This means I might not be open to new ways of thinking and resolving problems in different ways.</p>
<p><strong>Share an example of when you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss strategies you tried at the time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now and why.</strong></p>
<p>In many teams there is tension.  I recently took some advice from a colleague to ask directly in one on one conversation if the person displaying negative behaviour was ok.  I’ve had different reactions to this question but ultimately showing concern for them has helped to work through behaviour problems.</p>
<p>Based on online tests my top strength shows as honesty.  Speaking the truth but more broadly presenting oneself in a genuine way and acting in a sincere way; being without pretense; taking responsibility for one's feelings and actions.</p>
