      <h1>My Learning Plan</h1>

      <p>
        My long-term goal is to learn more about programming and develop the
        skills to build my own projects. I’ve worked in software development for
        about 15 years, and I would like to have higher-quality conversations
        with developers.
      </p>

      <p>
        For this course, my strengths include familiarity with some concepts and
        terminology that I’ve picked up from working in development teams. My
        limitations include staying focused and being methodical enough to
        follow the steps without jumping around.
      </p>

      <p>
        I would like to practice collaboration with others as a contributor
        rather than as an outsider or a manager of the output. I also hope to be
        more patient with people I don’t naturally connect with as much as
        others.
      </p>

      <p>
        I commit to studying and coding for at least five hours per day during
        the week, with any additional catch-up at the weekend to finish the
        sprint. I will read shared blogs, learn from others, and encourage them.
        In Sprint 2 I lost more time than I should have with a technical issue;
        I should have asked for help earlier, as the facilitator was able to get
        me back on track quickly and share a few extra tips I might not
        otherwise have picked up. I believe information is retained better when
        it’s from conversation or collaboration.
      </p>

      <p>
        I will timebox attempts to resolve blockers and try to resolve them
        myself using the handbook or ChatGPT. I will seek help from my
        facilitator if I don’t feel comfortable asking my peers.
      </p>

      <p>
        I hope that the facilitators will continue to provide one-to-one
        guidance if requested and remain patient and calming, as I have already
        found David to be.
      </p>

      <p>
        I will not be online between 9:15 and 11:00 am most days so that I can
        attend a gym class and do other life admin, although this is negotiable.
      </p>
