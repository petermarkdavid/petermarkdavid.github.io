# Javascript Intro

Welcome to Javascript! This challenge is made up of lots of little exercises to introduce you to the fundamentals. 

You can view this readme in the browser, or in VS Code. For those who prefer to view the readme in VS Code, using `Ctrl + Shift + V` (Windows) or `Cmd + Shift + V` (Mac) will provide you with a nicer reading experience.

## Setup

Fork this repo. In your terminal, clone a copy down to your computer, then navigate to that folder and open the repo in your code editor (hint: `code .`). In your terminal run the following commands to launch the application:

```
npm install
```
then
```
npm run start
```

You can then open the 'Local' url (usually `http://localhost:5173/`), or type `o` then `Enter` to open up a web browser which will give you feedback as you progress. It should look like this initially:

Every time you complete an exercise the web page should automatically update with feedback on your progress (i.e. change from red to green). When an exercise has changed from red to green, it has been answered correctly, and you can move on to the next question.  

Watch the videos in the Handbook and work through the files in `src/challenge` e.g. watch the Variables video, then complete the variables challenge, commit your work. Then watch the Functions video, then complete the functions challenge, commit your work etc. 

(You can ignore the rest of the code outside of `src/challenge`, it's just how we update the page with the feedback.)

## Troubleshooting

If the feedback interface goes blank and all the challenge results disappear, or an error message is displayed - that usually means something isn't quite right just yet. This may happen when you're typing the answer but it's OK once the answer is complete, or it may mean the answer isn't correct and you need to fix it. 

JavaScript is sensitive, so you'll need to be aware of and double check finer details like spelling, punctuation, using the right character/symbol or data type. If an exercise isn't passing but you think you've got the right answer, double check:
- spelling 
- upper or lower case usage as the question is asking for i.e: 'Kia ora' with a capital K vs. 'kia ora' with a lowercase k
- you've used the right data type the question is asking for e.g. are you supposed to be using a string?
- you've included any relevant keywords e.g. `function`, `return`
- you've got the right character/symbol e.g. `}` and not `)`

A tip for this would be to save and commit after each question you complete, so you know where issues are occuring and can undo the work you have most recently written and try again. 

If you get stuck on any of the exercises, we recommend the following:
- Google! Research key words or concepts in the exercise, see if they can help unblock you
- Review the video again and see if that helps
- Ask for help in your Homegroup or the tech-questions channel
- Message your facilitator for help.

## Committing

Each time you want to commit, inside your terminal you'll need to press `Ctrl + c` to clear the `npm run start` command. You can then close the browser tab, and in your terminal add, commit, and push as normal. Once you're ready to move on to the next challange, type `npm run start` in to your terminal to launch another web browser. 

## Pro tips for navigating Javascript Intro

- As Javascript is a language, naturally it has its own set of terms, phrases and jargon. If you're ever unsure of any of the words mentioned throughout Javascript intro, please check out the [JavaScript Glossary](https://student-handbook.devacademy.life/foundations/resources/js-glossary). Alternatively, do a google search, ask for help in Discord or message your facilitator.

- The video tutorials introduce you to the core concepts. They are a starting point but some additional research may be required for some exercises (we'll say when that is the case). These challenges are designed so that you can spend some time getting used to researching, and practising 'just in time' learning - so you can take in small pieces of content in a short time when you need the information without being overwhelmed with too much all at once.

- Remember to commit early and commit often; it is better to work in small chunks and keep committing your work!
