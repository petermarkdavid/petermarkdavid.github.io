// ------------ ARRAYS -----------

// 1. Define an array named `shoppingList`. This array should contain:
// Three strings that are the following fruit names: 'Kiwifruit', 'Mangosteen', 'Longan'.

// 2. Declare a variable named `treeResult` and assign it the value of the first element from the `trees` array.
// n.b. the code should work even if you were to change the array elements. `treeResult` should always retrieve the first element from `trees`.
const trees = ['Kahikatea', 'Cherry Blossom', 'Paogo']
// Write your code below this comment

// 3. Below is an array named `favouriteBrowsers`. Write some code that will reassign the value of the first element with the string 'Brave'.
const favouriteBrowsers = ['Chrome', 'Firefox']
// Write your code below this comment

// 4. Declare a variable named `arrLength` and assign it the value of the length of the `names` array.
// n.b the code should work even if you were to change the total number of array elements.
const names = ['Yuko', 'Amanda', 'Kahu']
// Write your code below this comment

// ------------ CHECKS -----------
// The below lines of code lets us test it to see how you're doing,
// don't worry about this yet you'll learn it in bootcamp.

// Don't change any code below this comment!
const toExport = {
  favouriteBrowsers,
